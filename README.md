# card-game
## TODO:
Board - Component Styling
HandActionMenu - Component Styling (Fade-in/Fade-out)
GameCounter - Component to display Cards have been played (Other game state)
API - Game Class populated from JSON stored on Server (Game rules / Options)
TURN/Phase System for card plays in redux state
Turn end disable actions - Limit player to a draw and a play
Opponent Play Cards on their turn
Replace opponent hand with hand component (Reuse)


## Ideas:
Drag and Drop - Play or Discard
History - game actions (Undo action)
